# Multi Markdown Viewer
This is a hacky way of displaying the contents of multiple markdown(```.md```) files on a web page. The webpage assumes the markdown files (except the description) are located at the "content_directory" specified in the ```_config.yml``` and their names are formatted as "yyyy-mm-dd.md". Since there is no way to fetch all content from a repository's directory, we instead try fetching singular files with a predictable naming scheme.

# Q&A
## Why?
Laziness. I wanted a page that automatically updates with new entries added to the repository. 

## Who is this for?
Anyone who needs a quick and dirty way of viewing multiple markdown files.

## I don't like the styling
Change it. It's all in the ```style.css``` file.

## Isn't bombing the repository with requests extremely inefficient
Yes but it was fast to implement

## How do I use it?
Slap your ```.md```-files to the "entries" directory and change the description to your liking. Update the ```_config.yml``` values to suit your needs. They are pretty self explanitory. If you use a different naming scheme, you need to update the script in ```script.js``` that loops through the directory. By default, the script scans the content directory from the start_date to end_date. If either one is omitted, both values default to the current date. For example, to look for all files after, set the start_date to 2023-09-26 and remove the end_date completely. Remember, however, that if the start date is far in the past, the script checks every day until the current date. 

To get the page working, you need to enable GitHub Pages on your repository. Go to your repository settings and select your branch to deploy. GitHub Pages will automatically get the values from ```_config.yml``` at the build step and pass them for the script.
